%First, appropriate study area for the project will be selected. 
Research papers on current state of Ev, the state of wireless charging in both static and dynamic mode will be studied. Major experiments done in the field of WEV's will be studied. Once the limitations and obstacles, problem statement will be formulated and the team will work on finding solution. For this, various design models will be made, simulated and tested using softwares like ANSYS Electronic-Suite and Matlab Simulink. Based no the result of our analysis, further recommendations and conclusions will be made.
