ANSYS Maxwell is the industry-leading electromagnetic field simulation software for the design and analysis of electric motors, actuators, sensors, transformers and other electromagnetic and electromechanical devices. It enables trusted simulation of low-frequency electromagnetic fields in industrial components that includes 3-D/2-D magnetic transient, AC electromagnetic, magnetostatic, electrostatic, DC conduction and electric transient solvers to accurately solve for field parameters including force, torque, capacitance, inductance, resistance and impedance. ANSYS Simplorer is ideal for electrified system design, power generation, conversion, storage and distribution applications.
